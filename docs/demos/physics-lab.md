# Demo: physics-lab

Phase 3's first demo (`docs/ROADMAP.md`, "Phase 3"): small scenes of bodies on a flat floor,
each one a test of the physics with its numbers and its determinism hash. The owner's plan
(2026-10-02): simple dedicated environments first, one per kind of object or effect (rocks,
barrels, boats, planes, rockets, fluids, creatures, destruction), then a demo where everything
comes together, which is the island.

```
cargo run --release -p physics-lab
cargo run --release -p physics-lab -- --lab drop --fixed-step
```

`physics-lab` is `city-blocks --lab drop` in a window of its own: it shares that demo's
renderer, keys and options (the sun, the probes, TAA, `--view`, `--capture`). **Space** throws a
ball from the camera at 25 m/s; **Enter** takes the scene back to its start.

| Scene | What it tests | State |
|---|---|---|
| `drop` | the binding: boxes, cylinders, spheres and convex hulls falling, stacking, rolling and going to sleep; the determinism hash | ✅ #136 |
| the fixed tick and replays | inputs as commands, the state saved, restored and hashed, two copies of the world apart by 100 ms | step 2 |
| `pool` | buoyancy: barrels, logs, crates and a boat on the water we render | step 3 |
| walking, vehicles, flight, destruction, creatures, fluids | the later steps of the plan | planned |

## The binding (`forge-physics`, issue #136)

Jolt Physics 5.6.0 (D-009) is vendored in `third_party/jolt` and built from source by the
crate's `build.rs` through `cc`, on Windows (MSVC) and Linux (gcc) alike, with the flags Jolt's
CMake sets for `CROSS_PLATFORM_DETERMINISTIC` and `DOUBLE_PRECISION`: precise floating point, no
fused multiply-add, AVX2 without FMA on x86-64. The build takes about 25 s on the 9800X3D and is
cached after that.

Between Rust and Jolt sits a C layer of Forge's own (`crates/forge-physics/cpp/forge_jolt.h`),
written after JoltC (Second Half Games): opaque shape handles, the layer set-up, and calls that
read or write many bodies at once (one call returns every body's transform). It is bound by
hand: no bindgen, no libclang; a test checks the C structs' sizes against their Rust twins. The
safe API has shapes (box, sphere, capsule, cylinder, convex hull, static mesh, offset), bodies
(static, kinematic, dynamic; friction, restitution, damping, mass, swept collision, asleep at
the start), the step, transforms, velocities, sleep, impulses, forces, a ray cast, and the
whole state saved and restored.

## Determinism

The tests drop a pile of 256 bodies (boxes, balls, cylinders, rock hulls), their rotations made
without trigonometry, and hash every body's transform to the bit after 5 s:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| the same run twice | the same hash |
| 1, 2, 4 and 8 threads | the same hash |
| saved at tick 100, run on to 300, restored to 100 and run to 300 again | the same hash |
| MSVC on Windows, g++ 15 on Linux (WSL's Ubuntu) | the same hash, `0x3e65693b88928ad9` |

The last is a test against a constant, so CI's Windows and Linux runners check it on every
push. These are the first, second, sixth and the cross-platform tests of
`docs/research/physics-fluids.md` §6; the rest (bodies added far away, a different insertion
order, record and replay across runs) come with the fixed tick in step 2.

## `drop`

A stepped pyramid of 204 sandstone blocks (0.8 m, 2300 kg/m³, eight layers), and 260 bodies
dropped onto it and around it from 8 to 45 m, turned and spinning at random: 100 red barrels
(60 kg cylinders), 100 rocks in three sizes (convex hulls of the city's boulder meshes, 0.35 to
0.65 m), 60 orange balls (0.25 m, bouncing). 32 more balls wait asleep under the floor for
Space. 496 bodies in all on a 800 m floor; the movers of #79 draw them, with their shadows,
motion vectors and the probes they wake.

![The rain in mid-air at tick 90, and the pile at rest at tick 600](images/physics-lab-drop.png)

The physics ticks at 60 Hz whatever the frame rate; the movers are drawn between the last two
ticks. With `--fixed-step` a frame is a tick, so a capture at frame N shows tick N; the log
gives the hash at ticks 60, 300 and 600 and over the run. Jolt has no rolling resistance: the
barrels' and the balls' spin is damped (0.3 a second) to stand in for it, and a ball still rolls
far before it sleeps.

Measured on the 9800X3D and the 5070 Ti at 1600 × 900, `--fixed-step`, 600 ticks:

| | |
|---|---|
| the world ready (shapes, 496 bodies, the broad phase, the state saved) | 204 ms; the state 82 KiB |
| a tick, 5 workers and the caller | mean 0.56 ms, p99 0.80 ms, max 0.89 ms |
| awake at tick 60, 300, 600 | 260, 452, 340 of 496 |
| the frame (GPU and CPU) | p50 1.15 ms, p99 1.77 ms |

## Captures

The batch (`tools/captures.sh`, set `lab`) takes `lab-drop90` (the rain in mid-air), its A/B
twin with the occlusion off (`lab-drop90-noocc`, 0 px apart: the movers are culled like
everything else) and `lab-drop600` (the pile at rest), on both geometry paths.
