# City plan — a city's layout before any building (`forge-procgen::city`)

The first step of D-059: a city's plan made from a site and a parameter record, judged as a map
image before any building exists (`docs/research/city-generation.md`, "Recommendation for
Forge", stages 1–5, and its extension §7–§19). It is engine-generic. The example below is an
invented coastal city made for the engine's tests and docs.

```
cargo run --release -p city-map -- --size 4000 --scale 2 --out captures/city
```

*The example city at 4 m a pixel.*
- **Water:** the sea, a beach, a river with its quays.
- **Blocks by district:** an organic old town on the river, perimeter blocks round courtyards
  (the pale insides), a waterfront, an eco-quarter, courtyard blocks.
- **Parks:** a river park, and the parks the 3-30-300 rule added.
- **Streets:** traced as streamlines of a tensor field. Eight bridges.
- **Transit:** two tram lines with their stops, a boat crossing.
- **Landmarks:** two red diamonds.

## What it does

| Stage | How | Module |
|---|---|---|
| Districts | each land cell to the anchor nearest relative to its radius, edges roughened by noise | `city::district_field` |
| Street pattern | a tensor field: a grid per district at its angle, rings at radial squares, the water's tangents near the coast and rivers (Chen et al. 2008) | `city::tensor` |
| Streets | main roads traced first (bridging rivers up to 260 m), then streets at each district's spacing; each stops half a block short of a parallel street, and its end joins the nearest street ahead | `city::streets` |
| Road graph | streets cut where they cross or meet, ends snapped, dead ends under 60 m pruned; blocks as the graph's bounded faces | `city::graph` |
| Blocks | quays where a face holds water; parks from park districts, then from the 3-30-300 rule (a park of 1 ha within 300 m of every built block); a courtyard per block, inset by the street and a building's depth | `city::blocks` |
| Lots | recursive splits across each piece's long axis (Vanegas et al. 2012); only the pieces on a street are kept where a block has a courtyard | `city::blocks` |
| Forest | ground above a height or steeper than a slope goes to the first reserve district (a real site's hills) | `city::district_field` |
| Transit | tram lines by the shortest path through their waypoints, main roads preferred (a waypoint far from any main road snaps to the nearest street); stops every 450 m moved to nearby junctions; lines added until a target share of blocks has a stop within 400 m (`transit::cover`); boat crossings where a river runs long without a bridge; street profiles (tram avenue, avenue, shared, pedestrian, path) | `city::transit` |
| Masses | each lot's building: the lot inside the building line, less the courtyard's hull; floors from the district's range, capped by the street's profile; green, solar or terrace roofs | `city::mass` |
| Maps and numbers | a small rasteriser: the plan, a checks map (blocks by what they lack), an oblique massing view of any window; the plan's numbers and its digest | `city::map` |

Everything is a pure function of the site and the parameters. Costs are integers in the
router, and `forge_core::dmath` does the trigonometry. Two runs give the same digest (D-016).

## Numbers (the example, 4 km, release build, one thread)

| | |
|---|---|
| Land | 14.3 km² |
| Main roads / streets | 59 km / 149 km, 8 bridges |
| Built blocks / parks | 674 (mean 1.66 ha) / 48 |
| Lots / blocks with a courtyard | 12 930 / 608 |
| Parks' share of the land | 10.5 % |
| Built blocks with a 1 ha park within 300 m | 100 % |
| Built blocks within 400 m of a tram stop | 45 % (two lines, no line added) |
| Streets' share of the land | 21.5 % |
| Tram lines | 7.8 km, 19 stops |
| Masses / floor area | 14 647 / 21.6 km² (15 ms) |

| Stage | Time |
|---|---|
| districts | 2.3 ms |
| tensor field | 7.5 ms |
| main roads | 2.3 ms |
| streets | 8.6 ms |
| road graph and faces | 10.3 ms |
| blocks, parks and lots | 10.2 ms |
| transit and landmarks | 0.3 ms |
| **the whole plan** | **≈ 42 ms** |

## Tests

`cargo test -p forge-procgen city`:
- the example has streets, bridges, blocks, parks, lots and trams;
- no block's reference point is in the water;
- every built block has its park within reach;
- the plan is the same every time;
- no two roads cross except at a node;
- lots sit inside their blocks;
- added lines raise the stop coverage by over 20 points;
- masses stand inside their blocks and outside their courtyards.

## Massing

![The example's centre as masses](images/city-plan-massing.png)

*A kilometre round the example's centre, seen obliquely from the south: perimeter blocks of
4–8 floors round their courtyards, green, solar and terrace roofs, the river and a bridge, two
tram lines.* Blocks whose outline is too curved for the building line's inset stay empty for
now.

## Next (#245–#247)

- Building lines per street profile, and a fallback where the inset fails.
- Squares at the radial districts' centres; the landmarks' sightlines.
- More checks on the checks map; a legend and labels.
- The style bible as data (#246).
- Then buildings from the grammar (D-039, #247).
