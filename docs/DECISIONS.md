# Forge — Decisions

Numbered, dated, never deleted. A decision cites the research that backs it and the demo that
proved it. Status: ✅ **accepted** (in code, measured), 🟡 **proposed** (needs the owner's
yes), ⏳ **pending** (research not finished), 🅿️ **parked**.

Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the principles these decisions implement and `ROADMAP.md` for
when each one gets built.

## D-001 — Rust for the whole engine ✅ (2026-09-24)

Client, server, tools and pipelines are Rust. The argument, honestly:

- **For.** Memory safety without a garbage collector in a multithreaded engine (the job
  system's scoped borrows are checked by the compiler, see `forge-task`); one toolchain for
  Windows and Linux servers; first-class Vulkan (`ash`), meshoptimizer, QUIC (`quinn`) and
  ECS (`bevy_ecs`) crates; `cargo` for builds, tests and dependency auditing; deterministic
  builds; the previous three projects were Rust, so the bricks port directly.
- **Against, and what we do about it.** The best physics engines (Jolt, PhysX, box3d) and
  audio middleware are C/C++: bind them behind a Forge trait (D-009, D-011) rather than
  rewrite them. Compile times: dependencies are built optimised once (`profile.dev.package`),
  engine crates stay small. `unsafe` is confined to two crates with documented invariants.
- **Not chosen.** C++ (no safety net for the concurrency we need), C# (GC pauses against a
  real-time audio thread), Zig/Jai (ecosystem too small for Vulkan + QUIC + physics bindings).

## D-002 — Vulkan 1.3+ through `ash`, shaders in Slang ✅ (2026-09-24)

Baseline: dynamic rendering, synchronization2, timeline semaphores, buffer device address,
descriptor indexing, scalar block layout, host query reset, draw indirect count. Optional,
detected at start: `VK_EXT_mesh_shader`, ray query + acceleration structures,
`VK_EXT_sampler_filter_minmax`. Shaders are Slang compiled by `slangc` to SPIR-V 1.6 into a
content-hashed cache; one file per pipeline family; `-matrix-layout-column-major` so glam
matrices are used as-is.
*Why not wgpu:* trails raw Vulkan on mesh shaders, ray tracing and descriptor features and
adds a layer; the previous project reached the same conclusion. *Why not DX12:* Windows only;
the server and a Linux build matter. *Why Slang over HLSL/GLSL/rust-gpu:* one language for
task, mesh, compute and ray-tracing stages, modules, generics, pointers to device-address
buffers, Khronos-hosted; rust-gpu still lacks buffer device address.
*(research: gpu-geometry.md §8–9; demo: meshlets)*

## D-003 — GPU-driven geometry: clusters, compute culling, mesh shaders, indirect-count fallback ✅ (2026-09-24)

Meshes are cooked into meshlets (≤ 128 triangles; 64 v / 124 t today via meshoptimizer);
culling (frustum, normal cone, two-pass hierarchical-Z occlusion) and emission run on the GPU
from device-address buffers; the CPU issues one draw per pass. Geometry shaders are never used. Every
mesh-shader path gets a compute + `vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCount` fallback producing the same
pixels (checked with `tools/imgdiff`). Since issue #5 the culling itself is compute (an
instance cull, then a cluster cull per mesh pass) and appends to a compacted list of visible
clusters **in a fixed order** (a single-pass prefix sum over workgroups): depth ties resolve
by draw order, so the order must not depend on timing. Mesh shaders (no task stage) or, on
GPUs without them, one indexed draw per listed cluster through
`vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCount` (the cooked one-byte triangle lists as the index buffer) draw
the same list. Since issue #3 the first pass's dense clusters (under 2 pixels of bounding
rectangle per triangle) can go to a software rasteriser in compute instead, on both paths,
when a frame holds enough of them to repay its fixed cost (D-021). Next: cluster
acceleration structures for ray tracing on RTX.
*Measured:* 127 M-triangle scene, 1152 instances: 6.1 ms brute force → 1.1 ms with
occlusion, 0 pixels different. Compute culling (#5): the two paths 0 pixels apart; the mesh
path costs what the task path did (0.180 ms bench, 0.326 against 0.322 ms for the ballad),
the fallback's draw about twice the mesh draw. Software rasteriser (#3): full detail
2.27 → 1.15 ms on the bench (6.41 → 2.48 without occlusion, 3.92 → 1.20 through the
fallback), the ballad at full detail 4.37 → 2.02; the LOD views unchanged (it stays off).
*(research: gpu-geometry.md; demo: meshlets)*

## D-004 — Coordinates: f64 nested frames, camera-relative f32, Y-up metres ✅ (2026-09-24)

`(frame_id, f64 position)` inside a hierarchy integer sector → star system → body →
construct; the GPU receives `f32` relative to the camera or an anchor; reversed-Z with an
infinite far plane in `D32_SFLOAT`. **No origin rebasing** (unsupported in multiplayer by
Epic's own account; each client renders relative to its own camera instead). Right-handed,
+Y up, −Z forward, 1 unit = 1 metre; Vulkan's Y-down framebuffer handled once by a negative
viewport height; Z-up sources (Blender, GIS) swapped at import.
*(research: large-worlds.md §1–2, §9)*

## D-005 — Our own job system, with the "leave cores free" rule ✅ (2026-09-24)

`forge-task`: work-stealing deques per worker, three priorities, dependency counters that
fire continuations (no waiting inside jobs), helping waits, borrowed fork-join scopes, task
graphs, a separate blocking pool for I/O. Client pools use `physical cores − 2` workers;
servers use every hardware thread. Background jobs stay ≤ 200 µs.
*Measured:* ×5.98 on 6 workers for a 16 M-element map, 5 µs job round trip, 5.2 M jobs/s;
with a worker on every hardware thread the audio stand-in misses 103/471 deadlines and the
frame tail hits 34 ms, versus 0 misses and 2.2 ms p99 with the rule.
*Not chosen:* rayon (16 spinning workers by default, no priorities, no continuations),
`bevy_tasks` (three more pools), fibers (unsafe in Rust). *(research: task-system.md; demo:
task-bench)*

## D-006 — ECS: `bevy_ecs` storage and queries, Forge executor ✅ (2026-09-24)

Use `bevy_ecs` 0.19 standalone for archetypal storage, queries, change detection,
relationships, hooks and observers, and replace its multithreaded executor with a ~500-line
Forge one built on `forge-task` (its `System::run_unsafe`, access sets and `UnsafeWorldCell`
are public). Determinism: commands applied in (system, entity) order, per-item seeds.
*Not chosen:* full Bevy (f32 transforms and its renderer fight planet scale), `hecs` (no
change detection), `flecs_ecs` (alpha bindings), custom SoA tables (only if profiles indict
bevy_ecs). *(research: task-system.md §E)* Accepted by the owner 2026-09-24.

## D-007 — One material record for every system ✅ (2026-09-24)

A `Material` is one row: render layers; physics (static/dynamic friction, restitution,
combine rules, density, solidity/penetrability); audio (footstep and impact sound sets,
absorption); gameplay tags (slippery, sinkable, deformable, flammable, climbable, buoyant);
weather state overrides (wet, frozen, snow depth) mutated at run time; a `deform` block for
soft materials. Terrain layers, mesh sections, decals and the visibility buffer all reference
materials by ID; a hit anywhere resolves to one (per-triangle material ids are native in
Jolt). Deformable materials own a clip-mapped displacement layer that physics contacts
(feet, paws, wheels, impacts) write into, that rendering and audio read, and that weather
refills (Batman: Arkham Origins 2014, Rise of the Tomb Raider snow).

## D-008 — Lighting tiers and the ray-tracing policy ✅ (2026-09-24)

Four tiers on one renderer: **T0 raster** (SDF-updated probe clipmaps, screen-space
indirect, SSR, cascaded shadow maps), **T1 hybrid** (ray-query DDGI probes, ReSTIR direct
lighting, hybrid reflections, NRD — the RTX 3080 target), **T2 RT GI** (ReSTIR GI + radiance
cache + Ray Reconstruction), **T3 path traced** (ReSTIR PT + neural radiance cache, opacity
micromaps, cluster acceleration structures) used as the golden-image reference. Sky:
Hillaire 2020 (lifted from the previous project). Upscaling: DLSS 4.5 via Streamline on
NVIDIA, FSR 3.1 / XeSS on Vulkan elsewhere.
**Decision needed:** ship with hardware ray tracing *required* (Doom: The Dark Ages and
Indiana Jones do; it removes T0 from the product) or keep T0 for integrated GPUs and tools?
Recommendation: RT required for players, T0 kept only for tools and servers.
*(research: lighting-gi.md)*

## D-009 — Physics: Jolt first, box3d tracked ✅ (2026-09-24)

Bind **Jolt Physics** through a Forge-owned fork of JoltC (`joltc-sys` on crates.io is stuck
at 5.0; Jolt is at 5.6): `CROSS_PLATFORM_DETERMINISTIC` on (≈ 8 % slower, needs precise FP
and no FMA contraction), `JPH_DOUBLE_PRECISION` on (5–10 %), one physics system per
construct/space, `CharacterVirtual` with arbitrary up for characters, its vehicle constraint,
motorised ragdolls (D-012), soft bodies for ropes and cloth. First three tests: Jolt's
documented non-deterministic corners (broad-phase query order, narrow-phase result order,
listener callback order). **box3d** (Erin Catto, alpha since May 2026, worker-count-
independent determinism by default, trivial to bind) is tracked behind the same trait and
re-evaluated at its 1.0 or in twelve months. PhysX 5 rejected for authority (same-platform
determinism only, bindings archived), Avian rejected (Bevy-coupled), Rapier kept as the
pure-Rust reserve. Water: far = analytic spectrum evaluated identically on CPU and GPU;
mid = server-authoritative column model shadowed by a GPU shallow-water heightfield; near =
GPU particles, visual only; boats by submerged-triangle hydrostatics.
*(research: physics-fluids.md)* Accepted by the owner 2026-09-24.

## D-010 — Netcode: QUIC transport, our own replication ✅ (2026-09-24)

Transport: QUIC via `quinn`/`rustls` behind a `Transport` trait — unreliable datagrams for
inputs and snapshots, reliable streams for events, TOFU-pinned certificates now, signed login
tokens later; WebTransport for browser clients when needed. Replication is ours: 60 Hz
simulation, 30 Hz snapshots near the player, ~800-byte packets under the 1200-byte datagram
floor, per-client byte budget with a priority accumulator, 32-baseline ack ring per entity,
cell-relative positions and smallest-three quaternions in a hand-written bit writer, cell
interest management, authority handoff between workers. Inputs: 60 Hz, four redundant per
datagram, a server-reported jitter buffer the client paces itself to (a starved buffer waits,
never repeats); reconcile above a threshold and fade corrections over ~100 ms; predict
physics contact groups; 1 s hit-volume history for lag compensation. Clients talk only to the
replication layer; workers are stateless `bevy_ecs` processes; MongoDB write-behind;
RabbitMQ for events only. Proof stages: 2-player handoff → 100 bots at ≤ 24 KB/s over
100 ms / 2 % loss for 10 min → 8-player hit registration → 200 bots crossing a worker
boundary with replay diff → browser client.
*(research: netcode.md)* Accepted by the owner 2026-09-24.

## D-011 — Audio: own data layer and mixer, Steam Audio spatialiser ✅ (2026-09-24)

`cpal` device I/O → our own lock-free mixer graph (bus tree, sends, RTPCs, states and
switches, HDR loudness culling, virtual voices, banks) → Steam Audio through `audionimbus`
for HRTF, occlusion and reflections → a third-order ambisonic bus rendered binaurally or to
speakers → HDR master. Events authored as data in Wwise vocabulary. SADIE II HRTFs
(Apache-2.0) by default. Acoustic LOD in three tiers: near ray-traced, mid ISO 9613 + SDF,
far virtual. Impacts and footsteps from modal banks fitted per material (D-007); rain, wind
and water textures driven by the weather fields; Opus for voice. Wwise/FMOD are the yardstick
(both free under indie thresholds) but not dependencies.
*(research: audio.md)* Accepted by the owner 2026-09-24.

## D-012 — Animation: layered, kinematic first, powered ragdolls ✅ (2026-09-24)

Server simulation object → **clip layer** (blend spaces of a few clips with inertialization;
`ozz-animation-rs` as the deterministic clip runtime; motion matching only once capture data
exists) → **procedural layer** (two-bone and FABRIK IK, foot locking through
inertialization, look-at, motion warping for ledges and vaults; emits foot-down events with
position, normal, pressure, foot shape, material and tick for the deformation system, D-007)
→ **physics layer** (Jolt powered ragdolls driving motors to the kinematic pose with a
strength schedule, so hits, shoves and falls are simulated rather than played; later a
learned tracker in the DReCon → SuperTrack line). Generated creatures are authored against
chain roles with gaits derived from the body plan (Spore's architecture) and IK onto the
ground. Tiers: full stack near, clips only mid, texture-animated instances far. Networking
replicates parameters and hit events, never poses.
*(research: animation.md)* Accepted by the owner 2026-09-24.

## D-013 — Vegetation, impostor ladder, trim sheets ✅ (2026-09-24)

Trees are grown, not modelled: Weber–Penn parameter files per species, space colonisation
with competition for the skeleton, scanned bark and leaf atlases (CC0 Poly Haven / ambientCG,
the free Megascans slice). Rendering ladder: 0–40 m alpha-tested geometry with wind and leaf
translucency; 40–150 m billboard-cloud leaf cards; 150–600 m hemi-octahedral impostors with a
light-facing shadow pass and an ellipsoid ray-tracing proxy; beyond, a lit canopy volume —
behind an interface a voxel aggregate (Nanite Foliage's direction) can replace. Grass as in
Ghost of Tsushima: GPU-generated blades from a hash, shared wind field, per-tile interaction.
Buildings use **trim sheets** (still standard: Sunset Overdrive, Uncharted 4, Helldivers 2):
two to four regional trim sheets, six to ten tileables, a decal atlas and vertex paint, the
shape grammar snapping tagged faces onto trim rows; trims can be generated procedurally from
SDF profiles. One normal-compositing rule (Mikkelsen's surface-gradient framework); KTX2 +
Zstd with BC7/BC5/BC4.
*(research: vegetation-materials.md, large-worlds.md §7)* Accepted by the owner 2026-09-24.

## D-014 — Terrain representation ✅ (2026-09-24)

Equi-angular cube-sphere quadtree for planets and a flat grid for islands, CDLOD heightfield
far field, dual contouring / Transvoxel volumetric near field for overhangs and caves, SDF
bricks for edits, genesis (uplift, stream-power erosion, hydrology) baked per region and a
deterministic runtime detail layer. Lifted from the previous project's design and code.
*(research: large-worlds.md §8, RESEARCH.md §1)* Accepted by the owner 2026-09-24.

## D-015 — Services: MongoDB persistence, RabbitMQ events only ✅ (carried over)

Unchanged from the previous project: persistence is write-behind to MongoDB (transactions
need a replica set), RabbitMQ carries asynchronous events (persistence jobs, chat, economy,
telemetry) and never real-time replication. Both stay on the Pi 5 until load requires more.

## D-016 — Determinism rules ✅ (2026-09-24)

No platform float functions in generation and simulation (`forge_core::dmath`, lint coming
with `forge-sim`); seeds derived per item (`Seed::derive`), never shared generators; parallel
results merged by index; CI digests at 1 and 6 workers, debug and release. Lifted from the
previous project's harness.

## D-017 — Demos are milestones; golden images ✅ (2026-09-24)

A system is done when its demo runs on both machines with numbers in `docs/demos/`. Every
demo supports `--frames` and `--capture`; `tools/imgdiff` compares captures with a tolerance
and an exit code. p50/p99/max, never means.

## D-018 — Memory and streaming ✅ (2026-09-24)

**CPU:** a tagged heap over one reserved virtual range (2 MiB blocks, per-worker blocks,
bulk free by frame/stage or by cell id), `slotmap` pools for tables, `bumpalo` frame arenas
until Rust's `Allocator` trait is stable, mimalloc as the global allocator for the long tail;
every allocator reports to Tracy. **GPU:** keep `gpu-allocator` now; replace with an in-house
TLSF layer (256 MiB blocks) or `vk-mem` when budgets, aliasing and defragmentation are
needed — budget from `VK_EXT_memory_budget` minus 10 %, render-graph aliasing of transients,
incremental defragmentation on the transfer queue (~16 MiB per frame). **Resizable BAR** is
used only for sequential, 64-byte-aligned, never-read per-frame data (what `CpuToGpu`
already does); bulk uploads go through staging on the transfer queue. No sparse residency:
paging is software page tables over ordinary pools. **Streaming:** dedicated I/O threads
(IOCP now, io_uring on Linux), a request scheduler that fetches by need (screen error,
distance, camera prefetch) and evicts by lowest need with recency only as a tie-breaker (the
cure for the previous engine's LOD popping), per-frame upload budgets, never a wait in the
frame; CPU zstd/LZ4 decompression by default (they out-decode the NVMe on this CPU), GPU
GDeflate through `VK_EXT_memory_decompression` when probed and when CPU headroom is short.
Cluster pages after Nanite: fixed 128 KB pages, root and hierarchy always resident,
GPU-emitted page requests read back asynchronously. **Container:** a table of BLAKE3
content-addressed, 256 KiB block-compressed, dependency-ordered, 4 KiB-aligned chunks; KTX2
per-level supercompression for textures. Proof: a 64 km² world flown at 300 m/s with
residency and bandwidth graphs and no frame over 20 ms, degrading to blur when the drive is
throttled. *(research: memory-streaming.md)* Accepted by the owner 2026-09-24.

## D-019 — Weather as one shared state ✅ (2026-09-24)

Cloud coverage, precipitation, temperature, wind vector, humidity in one struct written by
the simulation and read by rendering (precipitation, wetness, snow), materials (D-007),
audio and physics (wind forces). *(research: lighting-gi.md — weather rendering not yet
researched, vegetation-materials.md §8 — pending)*

## D-020 — Render graph: declared accesses, derived barriers, aliased transients ✅ (2026-09-24)

Every pass declares the images (per mip level where it matters) and buffers it reads and
writes, with an access kind (`ColorAttachment`, `DepthAttachment`, `Sampled(stages)`,
`StorageWrite(stages)`, `IndirectArgs`, …); the graph derives every barrier and layout
transition from the tracked state of each subresource and records the passes in
declaration order, one profiler zone per pass label. Per-frame images are transients of the
graph, laid out in one heap from their lifetimes (largest first, first fit among the images
whose lifetimes intersect), so images that never coexist share memory; their first use in
a frame waits for whatever last touched that memory, in this frame or the previous one.
Persistent images and buffers (`GraphImage`, `GraphBuffer`) carry their state across
frames; anything a frame in flight may still use is destroyed through the frame slots
(`Frames::destroy_later`). Nothing is culled or reordered, there is one queue, and nobody
outside `forge-gpu` records a barrier. Async compute and transfer queues are the next
extension (a queue per pass, timeline waits and ownership transfers on crossing edges),
as are transient buffers. The graph lives in `forge-gpu` (not `forge-render` as first
planned) because the app shell and every renderer draw through it and the barrier
vocabulary is Vulkan's; the module is written without `unsafe`.
*Measured:* the ballad and the bench through the graph are pixel-identical to the
hand-written barriers (0 pixels over seven captures, and 0 between the aliased heap and
`FORGE_GRAPH_NO_ALIAS`), validation and synchronization validation clean; a ballad frame
is 19 passes, 37 image barriers and 3 memory barriers, its three transients 25.6 MB. Nothing
aliases in that frame yet (colour, depth and motion vectors are all alive at the resolve);
the heap pays once post-processing chains arrive. *(research: task-system.md §F,
memory-streaming.md §2; issue #1)*

## D-021 — Visibility buffer: a 32-bit id next to the hardware depth, shading in compute ✅ (2026-09-24)

The rasterisers write no attributes. The hardware path writes a 32-bit id
(`visible slot << 7 | triangle`, the slot indexing a per-frame visible-cluster list of
`(instance, cluster)` filled by the cluster cull) into an `R32_UINT` target next to the
hardware depth, and a compute pass shades once per pixel from the id, reconstructing the
perspective-correct barycentrics and their derivatives analytically (no `ddx`, no helper
lanes; `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §4). The plan's 64-bit `depth | id` atomic target for every
rasteriser was built and measured with the software rasteriser (#3) and not kept: the
fragment atomic, the export of its depth and the clear cost 0.05 ms at the LOD views (bench
0.19 → 0.24 ms, ballad 0.34 → 0.40) where the software rasteriser brings nothing. The
hardware keeps this 32-bit id and its depth test; the software rasteriser keeps 64-bit
samples only where they beat the hardware's pixel, with the same rule (nearer, or at equal
depth the larger id: the depth test keeps the last drawn and the hardware draws in id
order), and a merge pass writes them into the id and the depth (amended 2026-09-24).
Material classification and per-material
dispatches (#20) sit on top of this resolve and read the D-007 table. Chosen over shading
in the mesh passes because it makes shading cost independent of overdraw and triangle
size, gives the mesh-shader, software and fallback rasterisers one shading path and is the
input the material table needs; chosen over `VK_KHR_fragment_shader_barycentric` in a
fullscreen fragment pass because the compute form has no 2×2 quads to waste on small
triangles and is the form the material passes will take.
*Measured:* ballad frame 0.27 → 0.30 ms (mesh pass 1 0.07 → 0.06, resolve 0.03), bench
0.15 → 0.18: a small loss with one light and one normal, expected until materials get
expensive. Culling A/B at 0 pixels; against the forward-shaded captures 39 of 1.44 M pixels
differ by more than two levels (slivers at silhouettes). The visibility transient is the
graph's first aliasing customer (it shares memory with the motion vectors).

issue #6)*

## D-022 — Physical light units, pre-exposure, histogram exposure, tone curves as data ✅ (2026-09-24)

Lights are given in photometric units and every pass writes **pre-exposed luminance**
(Lagarde & de Rousiers 2014): the sun is an illuminance in lux (128 000 for the Sun at
1 AU), its disc a luminance equal to that illuminance over its solid angle (1.9 · 10⁹
cd/m² at 0.267°), surfaces return albedo × E / π in cd/m², and each shader multiplies by
the frame's exposure so fp16 targets hold values near 1 from starlight to noon (sky values
are clamped at 16 384 before the fp16 limit). Exposure is a camera value, EV100, with
exposure = 1 / (1.2 · 2^EV100). **Automatic exposure** meters a 256-bin log2 luminance
histogram of the finished HDR image (a compute pass counting in shared memory, then
device-local memory, copied to a cached readback buffer per frame slot and read two
frames later, no stall): the black bin is ignored, the key is the log-average of the
samples between the 50th and 98th percentiles of the rest, EV100 follows it at 1.5 per
second towards darker and 0.8 per second towards brighter (Narkowicz 2016), with
compensation and a clamp, and snaps on the first metered frame. The adaptation runs on
the CPU (unit-tested, deterministic under `--fixed-step`); a GPU-resident loop is the
option if the two-frame latency ever matters. Temporal filters rescale their history by
the ratio of exposures. **The display transform is data** chosen at run time: AgX (engine
default, hue-safe), ACES as Hill's fit of the 1.x RRT + sRGB ODT (ACES 2.0's output
transform is not implemented), Khronos PBR Neutral; one Slang module serves the TAA resolve
(history and display image in one pass) and a stand-alone display pass, with CPU mirrors
under test. Emissives that cannot be physical at the same exposure (the ballad's stars and
nebula, eight orders of magnitude below a sunlit rock in reality) are authored in units of
a sunlit white Lambertian surface and documented as art-directed. Readbacks declare a
`HostRead` access in the render graph so device writes are visible to the host.
*Measured:* along the ballad's 90-second path the exposure stays within EV100 14.4–15.0,
changes at most 0.55 EV per second and reverses by more than 0.1 EV ten times (one swing
every nine seconds, the largest 0.52 EV): adaptation without pumping. The histogram costs
0.02 ms of GPU, the frame 0.30 → 0.30–0.31 ms. Culling A/B at 0 pixels, two runs
bit-identical. The ballad defaults to ACES (its toe keeps space black; AgX's 16.5-stop log
encoding lifts the nebula to a flat grey), the bench to AgX. *(research: lighting-gi.md §5
and §10; issue #7)*

## D-023 — Atmospheres: Hillaire 2020 tables in the graph, a per-pixel march from space ✅ (2026-09-24)

An atmosphere belongs to a planet (or any body massive enough to hold one): a Rayleigh
layer, an aerosol (Mie, Cornette–Shanks phase) layer and an ozone tent over a spherical
ground, in kilometres and per-kilometre coefficients (`AtmosphereParams`, Earth from
Hillaire 2020 / Bruneton 2017 as the preset). Empty space has none. Two tables are built by
compute graph passes (`sky/atmosphere tables`) only when the atmosphere changes:
**transmittance** to the top of the atmosphere (256 × 64, Bruneton's mapping) and the
**multiple-scattering** transfer (32 × 32: second order from 64 directions, then the
geometric series). Luminance is per unit of sun illuminance, so the result is multiplied by
the same pre-exposed illuminance as everything else (D-022). **Seen from outside the
atmosphere** (the ballad, orbit), the sky pass marches each pixel's ray through the shell
with both tables: 16 segments packed towards the ray's lowest point and the ground, exact
per-segment integration, the planet's own shadow; the ground under it is lit by the sun
through the air plus π × the multiple-scattering term as skylight, and whatever lies
behind the air (stars, the sun's disc) is multiplied by the ray's RGB transmittance.
Ray–sphere spans are computed from the point of closest approach, `(r − h)(r + h)`, which
keeps metre precision 20 000 km out. **Seen from inside** (ground, flight), Hillaire's
sky-view and aerial-perspective tables come with the first demo that stands on a planet
(Phase 2). *Measured:* the CPU mirror of the transmittance integral (tests) gives Earth's
noon sun 0.87 in green and a horizon sun red over blue by more than 20×; 16 segments are
within 4/255 of a 128-segment reference; the sky pass costs 0.11 ms with the planet out of
view, 0.14–0.16 ms with the ballad's planet (18° radius) in view and 0.31 ms for a planet
filling the screen, which a planet-view table would make a lookup (#26). *(research:
lighting-gi.md §6; issue #8)*

## D-024 — DLSS through Streamline's interposer, optional, TAA as the default ✅ (2026-09-24)

DLSS Super Resolution runs through NVIDIA Streamline 2.14 (the SDK in `streamline-sdk/`,
git-ignored), with the binding lifted from the `world` project into `forge-gpu`
(`streamline.rs`, every FFI structure's size and padding checked at compile time). It
is **optional**: the `dlss` feature (Windows) loads `sl.interposer.dll` in place of the
Vulkan loader (`Instance::with_streamline`, `AppConfig::streamline`). The device offers
`Device::dlss()` when its GPU runs it. Without the feature `Dlss` is an uninhabited type,
so renderers and demos compile without feature gates. **TAA stays the default and the
fallback**; U switches TAA → DLAA → Quality → Balanced → Performance → Ultra Performance
at run time (`--upscaler` at start), and the profiler zones are `temporal/TAA resolve` or
`temporal/DLSS` + `post/display transform`.

DLSS reads the same inputs as the TAA resolve: the jittered pre-exposed HDR colour, the
reversed-Z depth, the motion vectors (UV offsets, unjittered) and a 1 × 1 exposure of 1.
Pre-exposure is passed relative to EV100 15; DLSS's output kept the input's level. The
scene is drawn at DLSS's input size, with a jitter sequence of 8 × (output / render)² phases
and **the LOD error measured in output pixels**, so the geometry stays as detailed as the
screen (in render pixels the Quality and Performance modes drew visibly faceted rocks).

The render graph was extended rather than bypassed: resolved images carry their usage and
sampled layout for Streamline's tags, and a `Custom` access (explicit layout, stages and
access) declares the output, which NGX clears at the transfer stage before writing it
from compute (synchronization validation found the missing transfer stage). Tags are
`eValidUntilPresent`: `eOnlyValidNow` made Streamline copy every input first. The device
enables Vulkan 1.3's `privateData`, which Streamline uses. Through the interposer, MAILBOX
presents were held to the display's refresh in most runs, so the swapchain prefers
IMMEDIATE when Streamline is loaded.

*Measured* (1600×900 output, RTX 5070 Ti, ballad path average): TAA 0.333 ms GPU; DLAA
0.768, Quality (1067×600) 0.690, Balanced 0.662, Performance (800×450) 0.646, Ultra
Performance (533×300) 0.600. The DLSS pass itself costs 0.43–0.46 ms in every mode (it
scales with the output), the scene saves 0.1–0.2 ms at the smaller sizes, and Streamline
adds about 0.07 ms of CPU to recording. In a 0.33 ms scene DLSS costs more than it saves.
It pays off once the scene costs more than about half a millisecond more at native size
than at the input size (the city-blocks target at 1440p). Validation and synchronization
validation are silent in every mode and across the switch. *(research: lighting-gi.md §9;
